## Linux 

* **man**: Get information on anything pretty much anything
* **grep**: Pipe output from one command into grep and find stuff
* **tail**: Look at the last chunk of a file or have it sit there and monitor it for you _(we can't to that in Windows!!!)_
* **more/less**: Neatly browse stdout of another app
* **vi**: Next! _I still think this is for robots_

## Others

* Native package management on Linux, brew on Mac _(ok Chocolatey is coming of age)_


## MacOs

* Find port in use: `lsof -n | grep <PORT>`
