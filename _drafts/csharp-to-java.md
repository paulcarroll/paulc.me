These two languages are very similar and I felt pretty much at home immediately. I've already given a breakdown of how to get started with JetBrains tools when you've been using Visual Studio and now I'll go through some of the things you'll need to know transitioning to Java. 

Firstly though, why would you pickup Java and leave C# behind?

* Highly portable across operating systems. Ok, dotnet core will do the same, but that is still in v1!
* Spring is ASP MVC done right, seriously, it just works better.
* JVM is used for more than just Java
  - [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) is a very terse syntax dynamic language great for creating DSLs and as a gluing language. It generally cuts down your typing time too and freeing up screen realestate.
  - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is like Groovy in its terseness, but brings with it the benefits of a fully statically typed language... don't give up your compile time safety net!
  - [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) is used by the data science guys to crunch numbers. Much better support for concurrent & functional programming.
  - The list goes on..
    - [Jython](http://www.jython.org/)
    - [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
    - [Fantom](http://fantom.org/)
    - [Ceylon](https://ceylon-lang.org/)
* The libraries available are more mature and uesful, for example started using [Flowable](http://www.flowable.org/) which is just amazing.

Software development is more collaborative than ever now. People reuse libraries and code prolifically which is why you can argue about the pros and cons of a language, but that is moot, your team's productivity is now bound to the people contributing to the ecosystem. Higher calibre people lead to easier to plug components and richer community.
