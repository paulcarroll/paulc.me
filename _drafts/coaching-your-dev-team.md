A friend of mine at Search Party gave us a series of lessons around coaching that were simply amazing. His ability to change how you interact with your team members is impressive and that's what I'd like to try and write a portion about here. I'll just be passing on some of the tips you can use to immediately affect how your team gets more engaged and feels more ownership.


## W, W, W, W, H
Who, What, Where, When and How. These words are what you use to phrase questions, why? Because the evoke a response, it's harder to give a one word answer to these questions, they dig deeper.

## Don't give the answers
Never just give them the answer. 

One of your role as a senior member of the team is to lead. If people ask you a technical question and you just give them the answer all you've done is establish yourself as a well of information. 

Now some people revel in that position seeing themselves as the guru people seek out, and they are, but it doesn't help the overall team or business. Knowledge becomes centralised and person indispensible which is a huge risk to the business and a huge pain when they go on holiday.

When ask a technical question use your WWWWH to guide the developer to the solution. 

Ask leading questions to get them think the way you do.
