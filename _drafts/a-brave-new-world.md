For 25 years I've lived and breathed Microsoft products and now for the past four months my desktop has been reformatted to Ubuntu Linux and I'm typing this on my new MacBook Pro. So what happened? I woke up.

Seriously, I feel like I've escaped East Berlin. The air is fresher, the birds sing a happier song and I don't feel I've got a gun to be head as I march through another project. Leaving the Microsoft world was always risky, and I always said that when another OS becomes viable I'd change. 

Visual Studio was what kept me in MS land for so long. It's as addictive as crack, smooth as butter and a delight to use, or it used to be. However over the last number of decades it's become a fat, bloated ball of disfunction trying to lumber its way into the modern era. It was clear, the time to move was right.

JetBrains has done to development what Apple did to Sony in the music industry; and they just let it happen.

25 years of thinking a certain way leaves you humbled when you have to go back to zero knowledge. The amazing thing was that it actually took very little time to adjust. After all, Linux and MacOS are just operating systems. So you find the differents ways they do things. Then the real fun starts.

That fun is the realisation that you've been blind all these years. Like what? Like this:

_Users of Mac and Linux will find this a matter of course, but to us Windowsy people it's amazing_

## Commandline-centric

Everything is drivien by the commandline. I hated that, but it makes sense. No more esoteric interfaces with bazillions of optional checkboxes, just switches and yaml files... bliss.

Well not bliss, but it certainly works better because now I can isolate my configs, copy them, protect them in source control etc.

Stdin, stdout and stderr are first case citizens.
All the commands you learn on you machine work the same when you're in an SSH session, no lagging cursor as you try to click the folder icon on a Windows Remote session.

## An Open Letter to Microsoft

Dear Microsoft,

**I'm done** defending you.

**I'm done** spruking your positive assets and making excuses for your bad ones.

**I'm done** with your twisted views on operating system design _(File system paths, registry etc)_.

**I'm done** with each new iteration of Windows having the same Paintbrush, Calculator and Notepad.

**I'm done** with your proprietary fads; COM+, DCOM _shudder_, ActiveX, ATL, OLE.

**I'm done** with you treating me like an infant. Why have you not implemented two modes "I know what I'm doing" and "Where's the E-thing again?"? _(The latter for my Mum clearly)_

**I'm done** with the `"we don't want to play with others"` attitude; this is ironically at a time where the big MS is playing with others more than ever.

**I'm done** with your file locks _(Linx and Mac just don't have these problems, ever... it's true)_

**I'm done** with you rebooting my machine after a "critical" update even though I told you never to do that.

**I'm done** with your crappy commandline and pathetic BAT files.

**I'm done** with your lack of structure around the simplest things like logging.

**I'm done** with your rubbish concepts such as the Registry, Microsoft Installers, directory naming, weird concept of device mounting, poor user protection, poor admin/user/root isolation, lack of native interoprability tools like SSH... the list goes on.

**I'm definitely done** with Internet Explorer; even the new one is terrible. Seriously, do you guys even look at how that thing renders let along how abysmal the development tools are?! I made excuses for IE6, told people you'd learnt from your mistakes, but you haven't. Please stop writing browsers, it's not your thing.

**I'm done** with the ridiculous pricing model of SQL server.

**I'm done** with the bloatware hacked into Visual Studio so you can flog an "Architect" edition.

Through the 90s you made the best tools and a great operating system (not WinME), but you (well Steve Ballmer) arogantly ignored the incoming threats for too long. 

New kids moved next door with their sticky taped together Linux, but now it's not the spotty teenager it once was. The Apple kids switched to a real OS with BSD and powerful history of Unix built by the legends of the industry. Now the other kids have made a much more fun playground out of what you turned your nose up at and you want to play too... **now** you want to play!?

## In Closing

I'm out. **I'm done**.

You've broken me Microsoft and I've dared to peek out from under the covers. The world is not the radioactive wasteland you protrayed it to be. The air is pure, the water is fresh... and my future in technology feels brighter than ever!

You can have your closed source sandpit... I'm going to where the big kids are playing!
