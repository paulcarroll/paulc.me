I've already mentioned my shift from Microsoft to the free world and that was largely predicated on having an alternative to Visual Studio.

With my recent shift to Linux and MacOS I also started looking at alternative languages and frameworks like Java and .NET _(this was also due to dotnet core... another Microsoft framework to learn where they'd changed everything, again)_.

I started working on APIGeeks and with that NodeJS and Java came to the forefront. Javascript has been familiar to me for years as I wrote the UI framework at Search Party and also a crazy marketing scheme that involved a complex boids simulation on the Canvas. Java was easy to transfer to from C#, some things I like, some I don't, but overall a positive experience.
